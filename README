This code builds upon SansegoTek's Quest-Runner that supports only Fishing and Foraging quests. 

This code now supports gardening and mining quests.

How it works:
- edit the config.json file to change parameters
- edit quests section of config file to add which hero should be doing which quest.
- run quest_runner.js
